# About Me

I am a Linux and Open Source Enthusiast, who loves problem solving and
programming. I have worked on many personal open-source projects in
Python, Java and C++ which have helped me develop a good
understanding of Computer Science concepts.

Some of my projects include:

1. **[Competester](https://github.com/shaileshaanand/competester)** - A python cli tool to test competitive programming
   solutions(code) against multiple test cases and measure execution time.
   This tool comes handy when the programmer is dealing with a problem having
   large amount of test cases.

When I am not coding, I can be found listening to Alan Walker, DJ Snake,
Ed Sheeran, The Chainsmokers, Calvin Harris etc.
